This is a simple tool I built in order to paste in a list of my favorite twitch.tv clips and easily watch them back to back.

## How To Use
1. Run `npm start`
2. In the empty text field, paste in your list of Twitch clip links (separated by spaces)
    - example: `https://clips.twitch.tv/{slug1} https://clips.twitch.tv/{slug2}`
3. Use the Buttons to randomize the order of the list and play the next/previous clip
    - You can also use the right/left arrow keys for playing the next/previous clip respectively
